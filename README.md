# Virtualizer

Virtualizer is a project aimed to help you, having a virtualization system based on invoked callbacks (when you arrive
at the first item of the list or at the last), making you able to decide how to change the data (provided then to the Virtualier).

The `App.tsx` is an example of an integration, in this case we are manipulating the data with slices because we already have the whole data, but you can think of making HTTP requests ðŸ˜€.

In addition to have a more realistic example of async operations a spinner is showed when data is "loading".
